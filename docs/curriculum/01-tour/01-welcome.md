# Welcome to TypeQL

TypeQL is a query language for TypeDB, a database designed for complex, interconnected data. Unlike SQL, TypeQL uses **pattern matching** - you describe what you're looking for, and the database finds it.

## What You'll Learn

This tour covers the basics:
- **Entities** - Things in your data (people, companies)
- **Attributes** - Properties of things (name, age)
- **Variables** - Placeholders for data you want to find
- **Relations** - Connections between things (friendships, employment)

## How the Tour Works

Each lesson has a short explanation followed by runnable examples. Click "Run" to execute queries against a live database pre-loaded with social network data.
